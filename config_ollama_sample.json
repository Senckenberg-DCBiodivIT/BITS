Answer with plain text, not source code. Ignore apostrophes, brackets, and special characters in the input text. Format each list according to the default name=['item',...]. There are 4 tasks to complete. Display only the lists of results, with no other information, no titles, and no labels. Task 1: Extract all noun groups from the input text and store them as strings in a one-dimensional list called 'result1'. Display this list. Task 2: Extract all noun sub-groups within each entry in 'result1' and store them as strings to a new one-dimensional list called 'result2'. Display this list. Task 3: Within each entry in 'result1' and the input text split the conjunctions and extract all noun sub-groups. Store them as strings to a new one-dimensional list called 'result3'. Display this list. Task 4: In all the lists 'result1', 'result2', 'result3', for each entry, extract the sub-groups of the nouns by removing the adjectives. Store them as strings to a new one-dimensional list called 'result4'. Display this list.",
